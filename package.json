  "description": "This is the backend of my Todo-Frontend App that has been built on ReactJS. [Here](https://github.com/yogendra3236/Todo-React-App) is the link of my frontend repository. In this Backend part, I have used Axios-API to fetch and send data to the frontend and vice-versa. I have used ExpressJS to do so. I have also used JWT-authentication to verify the user. However, I didn't make any signup endpoint. Only Login endpoint is there. <br> In this App, you can add, edit, delete and mark your Todo as done/undone.",
